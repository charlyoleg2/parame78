Triangule
=========


Presentation
------------

*Triangule* is a *typescript library* for computing angles and length of triangles.

It solves analytically common triangle problems of Euclidian geometry.

It uses particularly the [law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines) and the [law of sines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_sines).

*Triangule* doesn't have any dependency.
